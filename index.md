### **Welcome**

I am a rising junior Computer Science major at Cornell University pursuing minors in Operations Research and Business. On campus, I serve as the Community Outreach Chair at [SHPE](https://www.shpe.cornell.edu/index.html) and am the President Elect for the upcoming 2020 - 2021 academic year. I am an active Fabrication team member of Cornell University's [Steel Bridge](https://steelbridge.engineering.cornell.edu/) project team, where I use machining tools to fabricate different steel components of our bridge for our yearly competiton.

## Experience

Last summer, I interned at [Technical Associates](https://www.technicalassociates.com/) as an engineering quality assurance intern. I was tasked with analyzing complex piping systems throughout our client's manufacturing plants and documenting the layout using P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams) format within AutoCAD.
